    <p>
        MSD is a curatorial duo (Sebastian Mira, Daniela Guti√©rrez-Gonz√°lez) whose interests orbit around the virtual and the physical space in installation and sculpture within contemporary artistic practices. The processes that we present as a team inquire about the quality of being present or near within digitality or screen experiences; we seek to address possible definitions and applications of living a moment in the distance or delay. 
        <br>
        But, in addition to this interest in screen practices and IRL/URL translations, from a shared interest in presence and distance, MSD maintains an affective methodology that translates into an eternal conversation and, in ongoing learning. We clearly understand that conversation is a redeemable and vital way of exercising political, artistic, and curatorial practice. Keeping close, finding excuses and exercises to support our project is a gesture of refusal. It is a minuscule act of resistance, the one we have at our disposal, in these circumstances (distance, absence, longing, crisis, sadness, worry). 
        <br><br>
        apostrophhheee. xyz intends to emphasize the importance of presence, touch, friendship, and hapticality, affectivity, bonds, and commitment to the people we work with. We are trying to construct curatorial or community projects that allow confrontation and affectivities, conversations, or critical models of understanding and coexistence that build solidary relationships outside the institutions (artistic, academic, or governmental). 
        <br>
        It is also a space for the reflection around touch, or the lack of touch, or the impossibility of touch, and how we can confront this through small acts of resistance that inevitably pass through the interconnectivity of the web. We are interested in this virtual simulacrum of closeness, care, and comfort. And from this moment of reflection on the haptic (or hapticality) and political friendship, rethink and re-signify curatorial practice and its relationship with a web platform. apostrophhheee.xyz proposes an affective, embodied, and involved curatorial approach. Thus, making this proposal an excuse to blur (even more) the hierarchical and obsolete lines between curators, artists, and cultural agents.
        <br><br>
        After the silent and intermittent communication  that was established between Sebastian and Daniela with the gesture of the hands (that touch things, that reveal contexts, that denounce the lack of closeness, that enunciate the will to at least feel close) and the beginning of the construction of this platform, now the challenge is to understand in what way other voices begin to join the project, the conversation. How do we go from the exchange of two people, who have been building up a unison over the years, to the conversation with Luis and Jimena? Do we or do we not enunciate this gap? What are the triggers for adding new interlocutors? What do the others begin to add to this already existing format?
        <br>
        Luis and Jimena began by reading us, by detailing us, and now they are adding, from their practices, new edges to the project, new gazes. Jimena Madero, from communication design  and the translation of some of our conceptual concerns into symbols  and visual identity; Luis Sanabria, from postulating as a piece the very conversation between us and, with a fifth mutable interlocutor that is absence, or distance, or the ghost, or impossibility. 
        <br>
        To these two new contributions, we add the action of reading together, of reading each other together, of reading what the other has already read, of forming an intuitive and joint bibliography, to which texts will be added. To reveal, also, through the gesture of the mark, the scratch, the underlining, the multiplicity of others who are part of this project of closeness and support.
